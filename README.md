# Merlin
## Learn how to create your own 32-bit system from scratch.

We aim to provide a flexible, open platform to learn or develop 32-bit hardware or software using either a physical or FPGA Arm solution.

The project will be built up in sections or episodes and use a modular design to allow you to extend or move in different directions should you so wish.

IDE: 
* [GNU MCU Eclipse](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.embed-cdt)
