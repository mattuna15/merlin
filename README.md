# Merlin
## Learn how to create your own 32-bit system from scratch.

We aim to provide a flexible, open platform to learn or develop 32-bit hardware or software using either a physical or FPGA Arm-style solution.

The project will be built up in sections or episodes and use a modular design to allow you to extend or move in different directions should you so wish.

IDE: 
* [Easy68K] (http://www.easy68k.com/moreinfo.htm)
* GCC M68K
  - Full working C/C++ environment (including Newlib)
  - Assembler support with Vasm
  

CPU:

* Framework Multicomp amended to 32bit addresses

* TG68 - 68000/020 CPU (heavily modified)

* VGA/HDMI - Gameduino 3X Dazzler

* Basic - EHBasic 68k

* Board - ARTY A7-35T

* Sound - Twin OPL3 chips (FM) Gameduino PCM

Storage:

* FAT32 SDHC Card support with C Fat Library
* UART interface with support for S-Record upload
